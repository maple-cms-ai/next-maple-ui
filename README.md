## Description

`maple-next-ui` is an opinionated UI framework designed to simplify web development for websites. Unlike traditional UI libraries that offer small, individual components, `maple-next-ui` provides large, comprehensive components. This approach helps developers quickly assemble sophisticated web pages with less effort. Our framework, based on `nextui`, extends its capabilities with our unique big components philosophy. 

`maple-next-ui` is opinionated towards SEO-friendly development, responsive design and common practices. It's convention over configuration project. This project is related, maintained by [MapleCMS](https://maplecms.ai) (Headless CMS that works for you) - extending its philosophy of simplicity and efficiency in web development.

## Motivation and Philosophy

The primary motivation behind `maple-next-ui` is to reduce the learning curve typically associated with front-end development. By offering large, opinionated, pre-built components, developers can focus more on building and less on the intricacies of UI design, layout, responsiveness, getting SEO just right. Everything that is important - is required.
